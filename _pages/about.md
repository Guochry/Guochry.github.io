Hi! I am Geyang Guo (郭歌扬). 👋 
I’m an incoming CS Ph.D. student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-computer-science), where I’m fortunately advised by [Prof. Wei Xu](https://cocoxu.github.io).
My research interest lies in natural language processing and machine learning, with a focus on LLM alignment.

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from [GSAI](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn), and was honored to be advised by [Prof. Wayne Xin Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JNhNacoAAAAJ).
Also, I had a meaningful time at Microsoft Research Asia as a research intern, working with [Dr. Xingxing Zhang](https://xingxingzhang.github.io).
